IMPLEMENTATION OF NON-PERSISTENT CSMA/CD PROTOCOL WITH BACK-OFF ALGORITHM it is used to in Ethernet to schedule re-transmissions after collisions. If a collision takes place between 2 stations, they may restart transmission as soon as they can after the collision. This will always lead to another collision and form an infinite loop of collisions leading to a deadlock. To prevent such scenario back-off algorithm is used.

## Problem statement 
collision occurenece between two stations while communicating , whenever telecommunication traffic increases collision occurs which means change of destination or colliding with other destination or transmitting signal to a non-designated receiver, this is faced by every member who uses a telephone for communication purpose
## About the project
To overcome from this problem we are using a media access control(MAC) protocol which is used in local area networking (csma/cd) it is a modification to "pure carrier-sense multiple access(CSMA) by using some algorithms

## Technical implemntaion 
To overcome and to update the csma we used the csma/cd in mac protocol

Back-Off Algorithm
non-persistent CSMA

## Techstacks used 
`python` , `libraries` , `random(lib)` 

## How to run locally 
steps to run the repository

step 1 : download/clone the repository
step 2 : copy the code
step 3 : run in Python - IDLE or pycharm locally in ur device

# What's next ?
we can make it more reliable by making it reaching it destination without any colllisions and not retransmitting again if collosion occurs
